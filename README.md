# Base theme class - proofpoint

Adds a wrapper to fix any proofpoint URLs embedded in a post whilst
is is being saved.

## Note:

This plugin in is an extension plugin to Base Theme Class, and so
requires that to be installed.

## Usage:

The plugin can be used enabled all the time - but if performance
is an issue (or not many proofpoint URLs get embedded) it can be
kept inactive for much of the time and only enabled as and when
proofpoint URLs appear.

To remove the Proofpoint wrapper URLs, activate the plugin, and
just update the relavent pages in the web interface. This will
fix the links and then you can deactivate the plugin again.
